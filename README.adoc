= Lifecycle Model

This model is a micro model: a small model that only introduces two new model elements - a single class and a single property - and reuses two existing properties from well-known ontologies/vocabularies to model the lifecycle of something. It does this by allowing something to indicate one or more lifecycle stages which then indicate their type and the time for which that stage is, or was, applicable.
